# Monster Battle Game
Monster Battle Game is an game engine for text-based RPG's that play like... monster battle games. Would be game makers don't need to write any code if they don't want to. 

By editing an array of provided text files, they can change the map, monsters, types, moves, characters. To begin learning that process, open the file TextGuide.txt.

Adding on to that is the Scripting system that allows them to add a bit of their own Python code on top of mine without having to dig through my code.

Those with higher knowledge of Python can of course further edit my code base to add new features as they wish. The full code of Monster Battle Game, including the template source texts, is made available under the MIT License. Hack away.
